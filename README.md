Rust single-process scheduling.  Inspired by [`schedule`](https://github.com/dbader/schedule) (Python), in turn inspired by [`clockwork`](https://github.com/Rykian/clockwork) (Ruby), and ["Rethinking Cron"](https://adam.herokuapp.com/past/2010/4/13/rethinking_cron/) by [Adam Wiggins](https://github.com/adamwiggins).
